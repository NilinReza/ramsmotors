## üìä Mock Data Details

### Sample Vehicles:
1. **Honda Accord 2023** - $28,500 - Available - 15,000 km
2. **Toyota Camry 2022** - $26,900 - Available - 22,000 km  
3. **Ford F-150 2023** - $35,900 - Pending - 8,500 km
4. **BMW X5 2022** - $52,900 - Sold - 18,000 km

### Mock Authentication:
- **Admin User**: admin/admin123
- **JWT Token**: Simulated with localStorage
- **Session**: Persists across page refreshes

## üîç What to Look For

### ‚úÖ Should Work:
- Page navigation and routing
- Vehicle display and filtering
- Admin authentication flow
- Bulk operations UI and logic
- Form validation
- Responsive design
- Loading states and animations
- Error handling (simulated)

### ‚ùå Expected Limitations:
- No real data persistence (refreshing resets changes)
- No actual image uploads (shows placeholders)
- No real API calls (console shows mock responses)
- No email functionality

## üêõ Debugging Tips

### Check Browser Console:
- Look for "üß™ TESTING MODE" message
- Monitor API call simulations
- Check for any JavaScript errors

### Network Tab:
- Should see no actual HTTP requests
- All "API calls" are simulated with delays

### Local Storage:
- Check for authToken after login
- Token should persist across page refreshes

## üîÑ Switching to Real Supabase

When ready to test with real Supabase:

1. **Set up Supabase** (see QUICK_SETUP.md)
2. **Update environment variables** in .env file
3. **Change mock mode** in src/services/api.js:
   ```javascript
   const USE_MOCK_DATA = false; // Change to false
   ```
4. **Restart development server**

## üì± Testing Checklist

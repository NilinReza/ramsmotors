# Google Reviews Integration Setup Guide

## Overview
The RamsMotors website now includes dynamic Google Reviews integration that automatically fetches and displays real customer reviews from your Google My Business listing. Reviews update automatically when new reviews are posted.

## Features
✅ **Automatic Updates** - New reviews appear automatically  
✅ **Fallback System** - Shows static reviews if API fails  
✅ **Professional Design** - Matches your website's styling  
✅ **Mobile Responsive** - Works perfectly on all devices  
✅ **Loading States** - Shows skeleton loaders while fetching  
✅ **Error Handling** - Graceful fallback to static content  

## Setup Instructions

### 1. Get Google Places API Key

1. **Go to Google Cloud Console**: https://console.cloud.google.com/
2. **Create or select a project**
3. **Enable APIs**:
   - Go to "APIs & Services" > "Library"
   - Search for "Places API" and enable it
   - Search for "Maps JavaScript API" and enable it (if not already enabled)
4. **Create API Key**:
   - Go to "APIs & Services" > "Credentials"
   - Click "Create Credentials" > "API Key"
   - Copy the API key

### 2. Find Your Google Place ID

**Method 1: Using Google Place ID Finder**
1. Go to: https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/places/web-service/place-id
2. Search for "Rams Motors, 2655 Lawrence Ave E unit m12, Scarborough, ON"
3. Copy the Place ID (starts with something like "ChIJ...")

**Method 2: Using Google Maps URL**
1. Go to Google Maps and search for your business
2. Copy the URL - it should contain your Place ID
3. Or get it from your Google My Business dashboard

### 3. Configure Environment Variables

Create a `.env` file in your project root with:

```env
# Google Places API Configuration
REACT_APP_GOOGLE_PLACES_API_KEY=your_actual_api_key_here
REACT_APP_GOOGLE_PLACE_ID=your_actual_place_id_here

# Google Maps API (existing)
REACT_APP_GOOGLE_MAPS_API_KEY=your_google_maps_api_key_here
```

### 4. Test the Integration

1. **Start your development server**:
   ```bash
   npm start
   ```

2. **Check the homepage** - You should see:
   - Loading animation initially
   - Real Google Reviews (if API is configured)
   - OR fallback static reviews (if API not configured)

## API Limitations & Considerations

### Google Places API Limits
- **Free Tier**: 3,000 requests per month
- **Rate Limits**: Sufficient for most dealership websites
- **Cost**: $17 per 1,000 requests after free tier

### Optimization Strategies
1. **Caching**: Reviews are cached for better performance
2. **Fallback**: Static reviews shown if API fails
3. **Rate Limiting**: Requests are optimized to avoid unnecessary calls

## Alternative Approaches

### Approach 1: Google Places API (Current Implementation)
✅ **Pros**: Real-time updates, official Google API  
❌ **Cons**: Requires API key, has usage limits  

### Approach 2: Third-Party Services
- **Podium**, **BirdEye**, **ReviewTrackers**
- More expensive but includes review management tools

### Approach 3: Manual Updates
- Update reviews manually in the code
- No API costs but requires manual maintenance

## Troubleshooting

### Reviews Not Loading
1. **Check API Key**: Ensure it's correctly set in `.env`
2. **Check Place ID**: Verify it matches your Google My Business
3. **Check Console**: Look for error messages in browser console
4. **Check API Quotas**: Verify you haven't exceeded limits

### Fallback Reviews Showing
- This is normal if API keys aren't configured
- The website still looks professional with static reviews
- Add real API keys when ready for production
